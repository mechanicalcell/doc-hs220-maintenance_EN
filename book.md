# 1. Safety
# 1.1. Introduction

The main purpose of this chapter is to describe the matters concerning the safety of the users of the industrial robot and the workers who maintain and operate it.

This manual complies with the safety regulations of UC Machinery Directive 98/37/EC (2006/42/EC) and USA OSHA and describes the matters concerning the safety of the manipulator and controller. The manipulator and controller are manufactured in compliance with the safety standards EN ISO 10218-1:2006 and ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999.

Every worker who installs, replaces, adjusts, operates, preserves, and maintains the robot system, must thoroughly read, and fully understand the operation and maintenance manuals. In particular, it is required to pay special attention to the&nbsp;  ![](../../_assets/작은주의표시.png) symbol, the most important warning mark related to safety.

Installation, replacement, adjustment, operation, preservation, and maintenance of the robot system should be performed by those who are trained for these purposes, following the instructed work procedures.

As our company plans and performs trainings on preservation, maintenance, and operation for those works, the robot users should ensure that those working on the robot receive the relevant trainings. In addition, it must be ensured that only the workers who have completed this training courses can handle the robot.

The users of our industrial robot are responsible not only for clearly understanding and complying with safety-related laws related to robots applied in their countries, but also for properly designing, installing, and operating safety systems to protect workers working in our robot systems.

In dangerous areas, where the robot, tools, and peripheral systems are operating, safety devices should be prepared in accordance with ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999 to prevent objects other than workers and workpieces from entering those dangerous areas of the robot system. The systems should be configured so that the robot system can be immediately stopped by an emergency stop system in case a worker or object should enter the dangerous areas despite danger. The workers are responsible for installing, checking, and operating those safety systems.

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
When the robot is transported, installed, or operated, the robot may fall over, get overturned or the arm may fall. Therefore, do not enter the range where the robot may fall over or get overturned or the arm may fall.
</li><br>
    <li>
If the pressure of the gas spring decreases, the robot arm may fall, so never go under in the direction where the arm may fall. To prevent the arm from falling when the pressure of the gas spring is excessively reduced, do not perform operation in a direction other than the direction of the origin of axis 2. Move axis 2 to the origin, and then supplement the pressure of the gas spring or replace the gas spring..

Replace the gas spring every 20,000 hours or when the pressure decreases so fast that the proper working pressure (125 bar–140 bar) cannot be maintained.
</li><br>
    <li>
When transporting or carrying out the robot, do not allow a large impact or vibration to be applied to it. In particular, if there is a large impact or vibration when transporting or carrying out a robot with a tool attached, the arm may slip or have a failure.
</li><br>
    <li>
If grease with different specifications are mixed, an abnormal sound may occur, so, do not allow them to be mixed.

</table># 1.4.2. Safety Nameplates 

Nameplates, warning marks and safety symbols are attached to the inside and outside of the robot and control panel. The name marks and cable marks for the wire harness between the robot and control panel, and also for the cables inside and outside the control panel are provided.

All types of nameplates are surely attached to the clear locations of the manipulator and control panel to guarantee safety and their functions.

The paint marks for the robot area or the marks for dangerous areas indicated on the floor where the robot is installed should be clearly different in terms of shape, color, and style from other marks in the facility or machine where the robot system is installed.

</blockquote># 1.5. Definition of Safety Functions

![](../_assets/말머리이미지.png )<font size = 3> **Emergency Stop Function - IEC 204-1,10,7** </font><br>
There is one emergency stop button on the controller and teach pendant respectively. If necessary, additional emergency buttons can be connected to the safety chain circuit of the robot. The emergency stop function is applied with priority over all other control functions of the robot. It can bring the current operation to a halt by cutting off the power supply to the motors of individual axes. This function will also shut down the power supply to prevent other dangerous functions that are controlled by the robot from being used.

![](../_assets/말머리이미지.png )<font size = 3> **Safety Stop - EN ISO 10218-1:2011** </font><br>
A safety stop circuit needs to be configured, and, through this circuit, each robot should be connected with the safety systems and interlocks. The robot should have a number of electric input signals which can be used to connect external safety devices, such as safety doors, safety pads, and safety lights. These signals allow the robot itself and peripheral facilities to perform safety functions for the robot. 

![](../_assets/말머리이미지.png )<font size = 3> **Speed Limit - EN ISO 10218-1:2011** </font><br>
In manual mode, the robot speed is limited to a maximum of 250 mm/s. The speed limit is applied not only to the Tool Center Point (TCP) but also to all robot’s parts that are to be manually operated. In addition, it should be made possible to monitor the speed of the equipment mounted on the robot.

![](../_assets/말머리이미지.png )<font size = 3> **Restriction of the Operation Area - ANSI/NFPA 79:2021** </font><br>
The operation area of each axis is restricted by the soft limit. In addition, the soft limit function also makes it possible to limit the operation areas of axes 1, 2, and 3 with mechanical stoppers.

![](../_assets/말머리이미지.png )<font size = 3> **Selection of the Operation Mode - ANSI/NFPA 79:2021** </font><br>
The robot can be operated in manual mode or in auto mode. In manual mode, the robot can be operated only by using the teach pendant.# 1.6. Installation# 1.6.1. Safety Fence

</blockquote><br>



As there is a risk of collision between the robot and the workers while the robot is operating, install a safety fence to keep the workers from approaching the robot closely. Otherwise, workers or other people may accidentally enter, causing an accident. Configure the system so that the robot stops when a person opens the door of the safety fence and approaches the facility while the robot is operating to inspect the robot or welding jigs or to perform tip dressing or tip changing.

Figure 1.2 Recommended Sizes for the Safety Fence and Entrance Gate(Quadrangle-Type Entrance Gate)


<br>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
The safety fence should cover the operation area of the robot, and secure sufficient space so that there is no interference with the workers performing the teaching and maintenance works. In addition, make the safety fence sturdy so that it cannot be easily moved, and make it so that people cannot easily step over it. 
</li><br>
    <li>
In principle, the safety fence should be installed in fixed manner. Please use a safety fence that does not have dangerous parts such as irregularities or sharp parts.
</li><br>
    <li>
An entrance gate should be installed to allow people to get inside the safety fence. A safety plug should be attached to the entrance gate, making it impossible to open the entrance gate unless the safety plug is pulled out. In addition, the wiring should be laid out in a way that when the safety plug is pulled out or the safety fence is opened, the robot can be put into the Operation Ready Off and Motor Off states.
</li><br>
    <li>
The wiring should be laid out in a way that if you want to operate the robot while the safety plug is pulled out, the robot plays back at a low speed.
</li><br>
    <li>
Install the robot's emergency stop button at a location where the worker can quickly press it. 
</li><br>
    <li>
As a replacement for the safety plug in case of no installation of a safety fence, photoelectric switches, mat switches, etc. should be installed at all locations that fall within the operation range of the robot, so that the robot automatically stops when a person enters.
</li><br>
    <li>
It should be made possible to identify the operation area (dangerous area) of the robot by a method such as painting the floor. 
</li><br>
</ol># 1.6.2. Placement of the Robot and Peripheral Devices

        </tr>
    </thead>
</table>  
</blockquote><br>



<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
<li>To connect the primary power of the controller or peripheral device, you should first check if the supply side power is off before proceeding with the work. There is a risk of electric shock because high voltage such as 220 V or 440 V is used as the primary power source. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Attach the [Do Not Enter During Operation] sign to the entrance gate of the safety fence and inform the workers of its intent. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Place the controller, interlock panel, and other operation panels in a way that they can be operated outside the safety fence. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
When installing an operation stand, attach an emergency stop button to it as well. It should be made possible to stop the robot in an emergency situation at any location from which the robot is operated. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Make sure that the wires and pipes for the manipulator, the controller, the interlock panel, and the timer are not caught on the feet of workers or directly stepped on by the forklift. There is a risk of an accident in which workers are electrocuted or wires are disconnected. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Place the controller, the interlock panel, the operation stand, etc., in a location from which the movement of the manipulator can be seen sufficiently. There is a risk of a major accident if the robot is malfunctioning in a location where you cannot see the operation of the robot or if a worker is carrying out works in such a place.
 </li><br>
    <li>
If the operation area required for the robot is narrower than the area where the robot can operate, you should limit the operation area of the robot. Limiting it can be performed via soft limits, mechanical stoppers, etc. Even when the robot operates outside the limited area because of an abnormal operation such as improper operation of the robot, the robot will automatically stop because of the operation area limit function (refer to the Manipulator Maintenance Manual.) 
 </li><br>
    <li>
During welding, spatter may fall on the workers or surroundings, causing a burn or fire. Install light shields, covers, etc. to an extent where the movement of the robot body can be seen sufficiently. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
In the case of a device that shows the auto or manual mode of the robot, install the device conspicuously so that the operation status can be recognized even from a little distance away. A buzzer or alarm light is useful for the staring of the auto operation. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Make sure there is no protruding part on the peripheral systems around the robot. If necessary, cover the systems with a cover, etc. In general, an accident may occur when a worker touches one of the systems, and a large-scale accident may occur when a worker falls by being surprised by a sudden movement of the robot. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Please do not design a system that requires putting your hand inside the safety fence to carry in or take out workpieces. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident of being crushed or cut.

In order for the robot to fully perform its functions. it should be installed according to a pre-considered, planned foundation and placement. If the installation of the robot is in a poor condition, an error may occur in the relative position between the robot and the workpiece during operation, or vibration may occur, resulting in degradation of the quality of works performed by the robot. In addition, the service life of the robot may get shortened and a dangerous situation can occur. Therefore, when installing the robot, pay attention to the following items.

<br><br>

![](../../_assets/말머리이미지.png )<font size = 3> **General Safety Matters** </font><br>


<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
<li>
To protect workers, the system should be designed and installed completely in accordance with the safety requirements specified by the laws and specifications of the country where the robot is installed.
 </li><br>
    <li>
When required to install the robot on the ceiling or wall instead of the floor, you must consult with our engineers.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Workers who use the robot should fully understand the contents described in application and supplementary manuals to skillfully operate and handle the industrial robot. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Workers who install the robot should be able to apply safety instructions if problems occur during installation. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
System suppliers should ensure that all circuits using safety functions surely perform the functions. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
The main power supplied to the robot should be installed so that it can be cut off from outside the operation area of the robot. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
The system suppliers should clearly ensure that all circuits using the emergency stop function perform the function in a safe manner. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
For a case that requires stopping the robot abruptly, the emergency stop button should be located in a place where workers can easily access it.
</li><br>      
</ol>

<br>

![](../../_assets/말머리이미지.png )<font size = 3> **Technical Safety Matters** </font><br>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
Should take into consideration the size of the manipulator and the operation range to ensure that there is no interference with peripheral devices. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Avoid installing the robot in a place where direct sunlight reaches, humidity is high, oil or chemicals are present, or a lot of metal powder or explosive gas are in the air.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Install the robot where the ambient temperature is within the range of 0℃–45℃. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Secure enough space to easily disassemble and inspect the robot.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Install a safety fence and prevent people from entering the operation range of the robot.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Make sure that there is no obstacle in the operation area of the robot.
 </li><br>
    <li>
When required to install the robot in a place exposed to direct sunlight or near a heating element, you should take measures in consideration of the thermodynamic state of the controller.
 </li><br>
    <li>
When required to install the root in a place where there is a lot of dust such as metal powder in the air, you should take separate measures.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Install the robot in a way that the welding current never flows to the robot. In other words, there must be insulation between the spot gun and the wrist of the robot.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Considering that grounding is very important in preventing a false operation because of noise and an electric shock, you should carry out installation as follows.
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman" start="1">
                <li>
            A dedicated grounding terminal should be installed, and its grade must be higher than class 3 grounding (If the input voltage of the robot controller is 400 V or higher, special class 3 grounding or higher should be applied.) 
 </li><br>
    <li>
The grounding wire should be connected to the grounding bus bar inside the control panel. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
When the manipulator is installed, if it is directly grounded to the floor by an anchor, etc., the controller side and the manipulator side constitute two grounding points, conversely causing a closed circuit to be formed with a risk of a false operation because of noise conversely. In this case, connect the grounding wire to the base of the manipulator and do not connect it to the controller side. Also, if vibration occurs when the robot is stopped, it is highly likely that the grounding is incomplete or a closed circuit has formed. Check the grounding again. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
When a transformer-embedded gun is used, there is a risk of falling because the primary power cable is directly connected to the spot gun. In this case, to protect the control panel and prevent an electric shock, you should connect the grounding wire directly to the manipulator base and do not connect it to the controller.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li><br>   
</ol># 1.6.4. Space for Installing the Robot

Install the robot after securing sufficient space for preserving the manipulator, the controller, and other peripheral systems. To install the manipulator and controller, please secure the above mentioned installation area. Install the controller in a place outside the safety fence where the manipulator can be easily seen and works can be carried out safely.

Install the robot so that maintenance work can be done easily when the door of the controller is opened. The specifications of the controller may differ depending on the type of the controller (for more details, please refer to the Maintenance Manual.)

# 1.7. Safety Works in Operating the Robot

Must follow safety work procedures to prevent safety accidents. In no circumstance, do not change or ignore the safety systems and circuits, and be careful of electric shocks. 

In auto mode, all normal works must be performed from outside the safety fence. Before carrying out works, you must ensure that there is no one in the operation area of the robot.

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
<li>
The workers who operate or may operate the robot, and the supervisors must fully recognize the safety and the function of the robot by taking prescribed trainings. The robot must not be operated by anyone other than those who have been so trained and designated. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Must wear a safety hat, protective glasses and safety shoes. 
</li><br>
    <li>
The work must be done by two people. One person performs teaching and the other monitors form the operation panel. One person should be ready to press the emergency stop switch at any time, and the other one should proceed with the works quickly while paying much attention in the operation area. In addition, workers should check the evacuation routes in advance before the work. 
</li><br>
    <li>
First, ensure that there is no worker within the operation area of the robot, and then turn on the power. 
</li><br>
    <li>
In principle, works including teaching should be performed from outside the operation range of the robot. However, when required to stop the equipment and carry out works within the operation range, you need to enter the range while brining in the key switch or safety plug that is used to change to auto operation. It is necessary to ensure that other workers do not mistakenly switch the robot to auto operation. In addition, pay special attention to the operational direction of the robot in preparation for an unexpected situation such as false operations or wrong conditions. 
</li><br>
    <li>
<img src="../../_assets/작은주의표시.png"> In preparation for an unexpected falling of the axis, you must be careful not to place your body in the direction of the falling of the axis or within the range where you may get crushed.
As there is a risk of the axis falling because of the slippage of the motor brake, the failure of the balance, etc., you should check before performing the teaching work. When it comes to the gas spring, you must check that the proper pressure is maintained before carrying out the teaching work.

When the test operation is conducted, there may be design errors, teaching errors, or manufacturing defects in the entire system including the teaching program, jigs, and sequences. Therefore, it is necessary to work with more safety awareness in performing the test operation. In some cases, safety accidents may occur because of complex factors. 

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
            Before operating the robot, check the functions of the switches and signals that are designed to stop the robot, such as the emergency stop switch and the stop switch. After that, check the operations related to the detection of abnormalities. First, it is most important to check all signals that are designed to stop the robot. When an accident is predicted, the most important thing is to stop the robot..
        </li><br>		
		<li>
            When operating the robot for testing, operate it at low speed using the speed variation function and check the operation while operating the robot repeatedly for more than one cycle. If a problem is found, please correct it immediately. After that, increase the speed sequentially (50% → 75 % → 100 %) and operated the robot repeatedly for more than one cycle at each speed to check the operation. If the robot is operated at high speed from the beginning, it may cause a severe accident. 
        </li><br>	
		<li>
           It is impossible to foresee what problems may arise during the test operation. During the test operation, never go inside the safety fence. Because of low reliability of the system, there is a high possibility that unexpected accidents occur.

Even when the robot moves at a slow speed, its weight is quite heavy and its force is very powerful. When entering the safety area of the robot, you must comply with the safety regulations of the concerned country. 

Workers should always be aware that the robot may operate in an unexpected manner. Even when the robot stops moving for a moment, it can move quickly the next moment. The workers should know that the robot can change its path and move according to an external signal without giving a warning. If you want to stop the robot during the teaching or test operation, you must be able to stop it immediately with a teach pendant or operation panel of the controller.

When entering the operation area of the robot through the safety gate, you must bring the teach pendant with yourself. By doing so, you should prevent others from operating the robot. You must hang a sign on the operation panel of the controller to indicate that the robot is currently being operated. 

When entering the operation area of the robot, you must fully understand the following items 

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
No one except for the person performing the teaching work should enter the operation area of the robot.

# 1.10.1. Operation of the Safety Electric Circuit

![](../../_assets/그림_1.5_안전체인_구성도_.png)


Figure 1.5 Safety Chain Configuration Diagram


The safety system of the robot is configured with a dual safety electric circuit that continuously monitors its status. If an error is detected, the motor power will be cut off immediately and the motor brake will be operated. All switches of the dual safety electric circuit should be connected to recover to the motor On state. If any one of the switches of the dual safety electric circuit is shorted, the contactor of the motor will be disconnected and the brake will be activated to stop the robot. In addition, when the dual safety electric circuit is cut off, an interrupt call will be sent to the controller to identify the cause of the interrupt. 

During the operation, the safety control circuit will be based on the dual safety electric circuit in which the controller and motor ON mode interact with each other. In order for the robot to recover to the motor On mode, the multiple switches comprising the safety electric circuit should be connected entirely. Motor On mode means that the drive current is supplied to the motor. If any contact point in the dual safety electric circuit is broken, the robot always returns to motor Off mode. Motor Off mode means that the driving current is not supplied to the motor of the robot and the motor brake is activated. The status of the switches is displayed on the teach pendant (refer to the “I/O Monitoring” screen in the Operation Manual.) 


<font size = 3><b>Safety Electric Circuit</b></font>

The emergency stop buttons on the controller control panel and teach pendant respectively and the emergency stop buttons installed on the external facilities are included in the dual safety electric circuit. The safety systems (safety plugs, safety area entry stopping systems, etc.) that operate in auto operation mode can be installed by the user. The signals from the safety systems will be ignored in manual operation. The function of stopping by the safety systems (general safety stop systems) can be used in all operation modes when the user connects them. In other words, in the auto operation mode, all safety systems (doors, safety mats, safety plugs, etc.) will be operated so that no one can enter the safety area of the robot. Signals from the safety systems will be generated even in manual operation mode, but the controller will ignore those signals for the sake of teaching the robot and allowing the robot to operate continuously. In this case, the maximum speed of the robot will be limited to 250 mm/s. In other words, this safety stop function is designed to secure a safe area around the manipulator while a worker approaches the robot to preserve and teach it. 

When the robot is stopped by the limit switch, you can change the position of the robot by jogging the robot with the operation keys of the teach pendant in parameter setting mode (Constant setting mode means the state of entering the 『[F2]: System』 menu in manual mode.)

</blockquote><br># 1.10.2. Emergency stop

An emergency stop should be operated when a person or equipment is in a dangerous area. All safety control systems such as the emergency stop switch on the controller operation panel, should be easily accessible from outside the safety area.

![](../../_assets/말머리이미지.png)<font size = 3> **State of Emergency Stop** </font><br>

The robot will operate as follows when the emergency stop button is pressed.
The robot will stop immediately in any case.

<ol style="list-style-type:square" start="1">
		<li>
            The power of the robot servo system will be cut off.
        </li>		
		<li>
            The robot motor brake will operate.
        </li>	  
        <li>
        	The screen of the teach pendant will display the emergency stop message.
        </li>
</ol>


The emergency stop can be performed in the following two ways.

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
Emergency stop by the operation panel and by the teach pendant (default)<br><br>
The emergency stop buttons are on the controller operation panel and teach pendant respectively.
        </li><br>
<li>
            Emergency stop by an external system<br><br>
            An external emergency stop system (switch, etc.) can be connected to the safety electric circuit based on the standard for application of the emergency stop circuits. (refer to System Board in “Basic Configuration of the Controller”). At this time, the wiring should be laid out in a way that the emergency stop can be in the “Normal On” state, and you must check its operation during the test operation.<br><br>
</li><br>
</ol>

Figure 1.6 Connection of an external emergency stop switch through TBEM, the system board terminal block.# 1.10.3. Operation Speed

To teach the robot, the operation mode switch should be in manual position. At this time, the maximum speed of the robot will be limited to 250 mm/s. # 1.10.4. Connection of Safety Systems

External safety systems such as safety lights, safety curtains, safety plugs, safety mats, etc., which are designed by the system designer for external use, are to be connected to the safety electric circuit of the controller in a way that they can be interlocked with the controller. These external safety systems are used as safety systems when normal programs are executed in auto mode. 
# 1.10.5. Restriction of the Operation Area

When applying a robot, if you judge that a certain operation of the robot is not necessary, the robot operation area can be limited to secure a sufficient safety area. When there is collision between the robot with an external safety system such as a safety fence, this function will minimize damage. The operation range of axes 1, 2 and 3 of the robot is controlled by mechanical stoppers or electrical limit switches. If the operation range is changed by a mechanical stopper or electrical limit switch, the operation range limit parameter should be also changed in software. If necessary, the movement of three wrist axes can also be restricted. The limits of the operation area of each axis can be changed by the user. At the time of shipment, the robot is set to the maximum operation range.

# 1.11.1. Gripper

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
      When required to use a gripper to hold a workpiece, there should be preparatory measures for unexpected falling of the workpiece.  
    </li>	<br>
		<li>
      When required to mount a device to an end effector or arm, you should use the bolts of specified sizes in specified counts, and use a torque wrench to fully tighten them with the specified torques. Also, the bolts that are not rusted or dirty should be used.
    </li><br>
    <li>
      Manufacture the end effectors considering that it can be used within the allowable load range of the writs of the robot. In addition, the end effectors should be structured in a way that the gripped object will not be released or dropped even when the power or air supply is stopped and also that the corners or protruding parts of it are surely treated to prevent damage to people and objects. 
    </li><br>
</ol># 1.11.2. Tools/Workpieces

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
      It should be made possible to safely change a tool such as a milling cutter. Until the cutter stops rotating, the safety systems should surely perform their functions. 
    </li>	<br>
    <li>
      The tool should be designed so that the workpiece does not fail even when a sudden power outage or control failure occurs. In manual operation mode, it should be made possible to detach the workpiece.

# 2.9. Limitation of the Operation Range

When installing the robot, you need to consider that its operation range can be freely adjusted within the entire operation area. 

It is useful to limit the operation range in the following circumstances.

*	When required to limit the operation area during the operation of the robot.
*	When collision with a peripheral device may occur
*	When the length of the application cable or hose is limited

There are three ways to keep the robot from moving out of its operation area, and they are as follows.

*	Software limit (applicable to all axes)
*	Limit switch (for axes 1 to 3: Optional)
*	Mechanical stopper (for axes 1 to 3)



<img src="../../_assets/작은주의표시.png"><b>[Caution]</b><br>
A mechanical stopper is a physical device. The robot should not be allowed to move beyond mechanical stoppers. The mechanical stoppers for axes 1-3 and 5 are fixed. For axes 4 and 6, only software limits are applied.

Mechanical stoppers will be deformed even when collided upon once, and their strength cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, the impacted mechanical stopper must be replaced.

# 2.9.1. Axis 1 (axis S)

By adding one mechanical stopper, you can limit the operation range (by 30˚) for axis 1. If the stopper block and stopper of axis 1 are deformed by severe impact, they must be replaced.

# 3.3. How to Transport

The robot can be transported using a crane and forklift. When moving the robot, put the robot into a posture suitable for each transport situation as shown in the figure below, and transport it using eyebolts and designated transportation equipment.

<img src="../../_assets/작은주의표시.png">

-	You need to move or unload the robot slowly and very carefully.

-	When unloading the robot onto a floor, be careful not to cause a strong collision between the bottom installation surface of the robot and the floor surface. 
-	Never transport the robot by means other than the specified transport equipment and methods.
-	When transporting the robot, be very careful not to allow the motors, connectors, cables, etc. of the robot to be damaged by the crane wire or forklift.
-	When transporting the robot, make it keep its horizontal level.
-	When transporting the robot using a forklift, check the bolts fixing the transport equipment and tighten any loose bolts.
-	When you disassemble or assemble the transport equipment (forklift brackets), the manipulator will slide. Fix the robot with bolts using the robot fixing bolt holes to prevent the robot from falling over.

# 3.4. Storing the Robot

When storing the robot instead of installing it, put it into the posture as shown in [Figure 3.3.]

![](../_assets/작은주의표시.png) <b>[Caution]</b>

If the robot is in a different posture, it may fall over. When storing it for a long period of time, take safety measures against the risk of falling over.# 3.5. Installation Methods

![](../../_assets/작은주의표시.png)
<b>Caution:</b>

Must read the safety regulations or related instructions carefully before unpacking and installing the robot. 

When necessary to use the robot in an environment other than the specified working conditions, please contact the service center.


![](../../_assets/작은주의표시.png)
<b>Warning:</b>

Installation must be performed by an installation expert, and the relevant regulations of the concerned country or region should be observed.

When unpacking the robot, check whether it is damaged during transport or while being unpacked. In addition, because the installation methods and foundation for the manipulator are very important in maintaining the functions of the robot, you should strictly observe the following items.

# 3.5.1. Working Conditions

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
Ambient temperature should be 0℃–45℃. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Ambient humidity should be 20% RH–85% RH, without condensation. 
</li><br>
    <li>
There should be a low amount of dust, oil, moisture, etc. 
</li><br>
    <li>
There should be no flammable, corrosive liquids and gases. 
</li><br>
    <li>
There should be no large impact or vibration. 
</li><br>
    <li>
There should be no source of a large electric noise nearby. 
</li><br>
    <li>
If you do not install the robot right away, store it in a dry place with an ambient temperature of -15℃–40℃.
</li>
</ol>


# 3.5.2. Installing the Manipulator

The rigidity of the foundation floor where the robot is to be installed should be able to minimize the dynamic influence of the robot, so the concrete thickness of the floor surface should be 300 mm or more. When installing the robot, you should perform maintenance works for irregularities and cracks on the concrete floor and then fix the mounting plate using the M20 chemical anchor. Also, if the thickness of the concrete floor is less than 300 mm, a separate foundation work is required, so please review this in advance before the construction work.

Position the manipulator on the mounting plate and then fasten it firmly with eight M20 bolts.

*	Bolt	 : M20*70 (strength grade: 12.9) 
*	Flat washer 	  : T = 4 mm or more, inner diameter (ID) = 24, and hardness = HrC 35 or more
*	Tightening torque: 5700 kgfcm





# 3.5.3. Installation Surface Precision

The flatness of the robot installation surface should be 0.5 mm or less.

If the flatness exceeds the value, the robot may not exert its performance because of deformation and damage to the base body.

# 3.5.6. Time and Distance for Emergency Stop 


While a standard load is amount, if an emergency stop is performed during operation at maximum speed, the response time and distance for emergency stop for each axis (S-axis, H-axis, V-axis) are measured as follows.

*	HS180/HS220

    Maximum time	: 0.615 seconds

    Maximum moving distance	: 43.70 Inch / 111 cm


*	HS160L 

    Maximum time	: 0.435 seconds

    Maximum moving distance	: 30.27 Inch / 76.9 cm



# 3.5.7. Connecting a Load

In the case of a load to be attached to the tip of the wrist axis of the robot, you should limit the load attachment method and form to prevent abrasion from being caused by contact with the R1 axis part that performs relative motions. If these limits are not properly applied, the resulting contact may damage the seal and cause oil leakage.


![](../../_assets/그림_3.12_로봇_끝단_취부형태.png  )

Figure 3.9 Form of Attachment to the Tip of the Robot# 3.6. Allowable Loade for the Wrist Axis



# 3.6.1. Calculating the Allowable Load Torque

The load to be attached to the tip of the wrist axis of the robot is regulated by the allowable weight, allowable load torque, and allowable moment of inertia. The direction of the coordinate system to be used for calculating the load torque and moment of inertia is the same as that of the robot base coordinate system. The review of the R2 axis will be performed in the same way as done for the B axis.

*	Step 1

    Calculate the position of the center of gravity at the center of rotation of the B axis (L<sub>X</sub>, L<sub>Y</sub>, L<sub>Z</sub>.)

    L<sub>x</sub>: Position of the center of gravity in the direction of X axis

    L<sub>y</sub>: Position of the center of gravity in the direction of Y axis

    L<sub>z</sub>: Position of the center of gravity in the direction of Z axis



*	Step 2

    Calculate the distance from the B and R1 axes to the center of gravity respectively.

    L<sub>B</sub> : Distance from the center of rotation of B axis to the center of gravity

    L<sub>R1</sub> : Distance from the center of rotation of the R1 axis to the center of gravity

    $L_{B}=\sqrt{{{L_{x}}^{2}}+{{L_{z}}^{2}}}$ , $L_{R1}=\sqrt{{{L_{y}}^{2}}+{{L_{z}}^{2}}}$

*	Step 3

    Calculate the load torque based on the calculated distance.

    $T_{B}=MgL_{B}$  , $T_{R1}=MgL_{R1}$

    $T_{B}$ : Load torque at the center of rotation of B axis

    $T_{R1}$ : Load torque at the center of rotation of the R1 axis

    $M$ : Load mass
    
    $g$ : Gravitational acceleration


*	Step 4

    Check whether the load torque calculated in Step 3 is below the limit value based on the table of allowable load torques.

 
* Note: If the load mass is similar to the mass indicated on the torque curve below, the verification of the load torque can be substituted by checking whether the distance calculated in Step 2 is distributed within the torque curve instead of going through Steps 3 and 4. If the calculated distance is within the torque curve, the calculated load torque is smaller than the allowable load torque, and if it is located outside the torque curve, the calculated load torque is larger than the allowable load torque.

    Calculate the moment of inertia of the load at the center of each writ axis  (J<sub>a4</sub>, J<sub>a5</sub>, J<sub>a6</sub>)

    J<sub>a4</sub> - Moment of inertia at the center of rotation of the R2 axis

    J<sub>a5</sub> - Moment of inertia at the center of rotation of the B axis

<br></br>
☞ Load condition: Stainless Steel (with mass of 138.15 kg) with a width of 260 mm and a thickness of 260 mm

① Weight limit

Load weight: 138.15 ≤180 kg

<br>

② Limit of the allowable torque

The position of the center of gravity with respect to B axis L<sub>X</sub> = 350mm, L<sub>Y</sub> = 0mm, L<sub>Z</sub> = -60mm

Each distance from B axis and R1 axis to the center of gravity can be calculated respectively as follows.

Distance with respect to the B axis  $L_{B} = \sqrt{0.35^{2} + 0.06^{2}} = 0.355m$

Distance with respect to the R1 axis $L_{R1}$ = 0.06m

Load torque of the B axis $T_{B}=MgL_{B}$ 

Load torque of the R1 axis $T_{R1}=MgL_{R1}$

<br>

③ Limit of the allowable moment of inertia

The moments of inertia of the load at the center of gravity  J<sub>xx</sub>= 1.56kgm², J<sub>yy</sub>= 1.56 kgm², J<sub>zz</sub>= 1.56 kgm²
    
Moment of inertia of the B axis  (Ja5)

$J_{a5}=ML_{B}^{2}+J_{yy} = 138.15\times 0.355^{2} + 1.56 = 18.97\leq 106kgm^{2}$

Moment of inertia of the R1 axis  (Ja6)

$J_{a6}=ML_{R1}^{2}+J_{xx} = 138.15\times 0.06^{2} + 1.56 = 2.06\leq 56kgm^{2}$

<br>
  
④ Conclusion

It is safe because all conditions of weight, torque, and moment of inertia satisfy the conditions of limit.

<br>

① Weight limit

Load weight: 176.3 ≤180 kg

② Limit of the allowable torque

The position of the center of gravity of all loads at the center of rotation of the B axis can be calculated as follows.




$L_{x}=\frac{\sum_{i}^{}m_{i}L_{xi}}{\sum_{i}^{}m_{i}}=\frac{14.6X250+125.4X460+36.3X840}{176.3}=520.85mm$

$L_{y}$= 0 mm (Since the y-axis is symmetrical)

$L_{z}=\frac{\sum_{i}^{}m_{i}L_{zi}}{\sum_{i}^{}m_{i}}=\frac{14.6X0+125.4X260+36.3X260}{176.3}=238.47mm$


<br>

Position of the center of gravity of all blocks with respect to B axis $L_{x}$ = 520.85mm, $L_{y}$ = 0mm $L_{z}$ = -238.47mm

<br>

Distance from the B axis to the center of gravity $L_{B} = \sqrt{0.521^{2} + 0.238^{2}} = 0.573m$

Distance from the R1 axis to the center of gravity $L_{R1} = \sqrt{0.238^{2} + 0.0^{2}} = 0.238m$

<br>

Load torque of the B axis $T_{B}=MgL_{B} = 101.02kgfm ≤ 110kgfm$

=[14.6 X (0.25²) + 0.114]+[125.4 X (0.46² + 0.26²) + 2.915]+[36.3 X (0.85² +0.26²) + 0.314] = 67.95 ≤ 106kgm²

<br>

Moment of inertia of the R1 axis  (J<sub>a6</sub>)

J<sub>a6</sub> = $\sum_{i}^{}\left [ mi(L_{yi}^{2}+L_{zi}^{2})+j_{xxi} \right ]$

=[14.6 X (0²) + 0.219]+[125.4 X (0.26²) + 2.530]+[36.3 X (0.26²) + 0.350] = 14.03 ≤ 56kgm²

<br>
④ Conclusion

It is safe because all conditions of weight, torque, and moment of inertia satisfy the conditions of limit. 



# 4. Inspection

This chapter describes regular inspection, disassembly, and adjustment necessary to maintain the performance of the robot for a long time.# 4.1. Inspection Plan

Inspection is absolutely necessary to maintain high performance when operating the robot for a long period of time.
Inspection consists of daily inspections and periodic inspections. The basic inspection cycles are indicated in [Table 4-1]. The person in charge of inspection must conduct inspections according to the inspection cycles.
Should perform overhauling every 35,000 operation hours. 

As the inspection cycles were reviewed for the spot welding, it is recommended to perform inspections at about half the cycles shown in [Table 4-1] for high-accuracy operations such as handling. If it is difficult to understand the inspection and adjustment methods, contact our Aftersales Service Center (Customer Support Department.)

<br>

*	If the robot is used in adverse conditions (for example, spot welding, grinding, etc.), you need to shorten the inspection cycles to secure the performance of the robot system.

*	Inspect all cables that can be seen, and replace damaged ones.

*	Check the mechanical bumpers for any deformation or damage. If a bumper is damaged or a dog is bent, replace it immediately.

*	Check the tightening torques of the main bolts shown in [Figure 4.1].

*	Check for an abnormal sound in auto mode and teaching mode to check the power transmission systems (motors, reducers, etc.) for any abnormality.

*	Inspect the gas spring periodically to maintain the proper working pressure, and inject gas when the pressure drops. 

*	Replace the gas spring after using it for a certain period of time.

*	Replace the gas spring every 20,000 hours or when the proper working pressure (125 bar–140 bar) cannot be maintained even after gas is injected.

*	If the load estimation has been performed correctly, the pressure of the gas spring can be checked from the teaching pendant. Therefore, use the gas spring pressure test function by referring to the Controller Function Manual.
There are two pressure test methods: “Command-based gas spring pressure test” and “Gas spring pressure test at stop position.”
It is recommended to use the “Command-based gas spring pressure test” method, which has higher accuracy.

*	If the teaching pendant generates an error or warning related to the gas spring pressure drop, you must check the pressure of the gas spring.

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
Must wear protective glasses before injecting or inspecting the grease.
  </li><br>
    <li>
Must remove the outlet plug before injecting the grease.
  </li><br>
    <li>
When the plug is loosened, the grease and plug may be abruptly discharged. Block the outlet with a thick cloth to prevent the discharged object from damaging parts of your body, such as the face, and keep a safe distance (Do not look into the grease outlet.)
  </li><br>
    <li>
If possible, do not use a compressed air pump powered by factory-supplied air, and limit the grease injection pressure to 1.5 bar (1.5 kgf/cm2, 0.15 MPA) or less. 
  </li><br>
    <li>
Use only the specified grease. Otherwise, the reducer may be damaged or other problems may be caused.
  </li><br>
    <li>
After injecting the grease, check whether there is any leakage from the grease outlet and whether there is any pressure at the inlet. Remove the residual pressure according to the method suggested for each axis, and then connect the plug.
  </li><br>
    <li>
To prevent accidents, wipe off any spilled grease on the robot body or floor.
  </li><br>
    <li>
If the robot is used at an ambient temperature of 35℃ or higher, the grease replenishment and replacement cycles should be shortened by half.
  </li><br>
    <li>
When replacing grease, replace the specified amount and inject new grease as much as the amount of the discharged grease.
  </li><br>
    <li>
If an abnormal sound is generated from the reducer part during operation after replenishment or replacement of grease, at low temperature, at low speed, or after long-term non-operation,
you need to operate the robot while checking the state of the abnormal sound for 1 to 2 days. Abnormal sound caused by grease will disappear
  </li><br>
    <li>
If grease with a different specification is injected into a reducer part greased already, an abnormal sound may occur from the reducer part. Therefore, do not mix different types of grease.
  </li><br>
    <li>
An abnormal sound may occur even if the old grease is replaced with the new grease of the same designated specification as the old grease.
  </li><br>
    <li>
Replacing the grease is not a work for completely removing the old grease. A significant amount of old grease will remain.
</li><br>	
</ol>

<br></br>
■ Grease replacement cycle

-	S-axis reducer and arm frame gear box	: Every 24,000 hours
-	Other reducers : Every 12,000 hours
-	Gas spring bearing : Every six months (every three months in adverse situations)



 <br>


■ Measures for and Causes of Abnormal Grease Sound


If an abnormal sound is generated in the reducer part despite using the specified grease, check the condition for 1 to 2 days while performing operation. The abnormal sound usually disappears.

-	It can be checked that the abnormal sound will disappear even when the concerned axis is operated at high speed for about 5 to 10 min or more.
-	When the old grease is discharged as much as possible (about 90% or more) and replaced with new grease, abnormal grease sound can be minimized (When the grease is discharged while the axis is rotating at low speed, the grease discharge time can be shortened.)

Abnormal sound usually occur in the following cases.
-	During operation after replacement of grease/reducer
-	During operation after a long-term non-operation
-	During operation at low speed
-	During operation at low temperature
-	When using unspecified grease
-	Mixing of grease of different specifications

    <li>
Attach a grease receiver such as vinyl with an opened entrance to the grease outlet to prevent contamination of the surrounding area.
  </li><br>

    <td colspan="4">If air is supplied at too high a pressure to the inside of the grease barrel, etc. of the gearbox where grease is injected, there is a risk of grease suddenly ejecting. It must be covered so that the grease being charged from the grease outlet can only be discharged to the grease receiver. When discharging grease, you should wear safety clothing such as protective glasses, a face shield, and protective clothing.
<p>

To ensure that the pressure inside the grease barrel does not exceed 0.025 Mpa, you should set the pressure of the regulator by increasing its pressure from 0 Mpa to 0.025 Mpa gradually before installing it to the grease barrel. After that, check whether the set pressure is appropriate by opening and closing the stop valve several times, and then install the regulator set to the outlet of the grease barrel. After installing the set, open and close the stop valve to check once more if the pressure is appropriate.

# 6. Troubleshooting



# 6.1. How to Investigate the Causes of Troubles

When an abnormality occurs during the operation the robot, and if it is not a problem with the controller, it is a problem attributable to damaged mechanical parts. To handle troubles easily and quickly, it is required to first accurately identify the phenomenon and determine to which parts the defects are attributable.

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
	<li>Step 1: Which axis has the abnormality?
First, check which axis has an abnormal phenomenon. When a strange phenomenon does not appear during the operation and it is difficult to judge, you should investigate the following items.

-	Is there any area where an abnormal sound is generated?
-	Is there any area where abnormal heating occurs?
-	Is there any part that has clearance?

</li><br>
	<li>Step 2: Is there any damaged part?
If an axis with an abnormality is identified, investigate which part is the cause. There can be multiple causes for one phenomenon. Refer to [Table 6-1] for symptoms and causes of troubles shown on the next page.
</li><br>
	<li>Step 3: Handling defective parts
Dispose of parts that are found to be defective in the manner described in 『6.3 Methods to Investigate and Handle Each Part』. For matters other than those that can be handled by your company, please contact our service department.
</li>
</ol> 

# 6.2. Symptoms and Causes of Troubles  

As shown in [Table 6-1], there can be multiple parts that are thought to be the cause of a single phenomenon. 
Please refer to the next page to determine which parts are damaged.

[Note 1] Overloaded ------------	A phenomenon that occurs when a load exceeding the conditions of the rated specification of the motor is applied.

Specifically, it occurs when the temperature relay or circuit breaker is cut off.

[Note 2] Vibration during operation ------- Vibration that occurs during operation

[Note 3] If an abnormal sound is generated in the reducer part during operation at low speed, check the condition for 1 to 2 days while performing operation. The abnormal sound usually disappears.

-	It can be checked that the abnormal sound will disappear even when the concerned axis is operated at high speed for about 5 to 10 min or more.
-	When the old grease is discharged as much as possible (about 90% or more) and replaced with new grease, abnormal grease sound can be minimized.

(When the grease is discharged while the axis is rotating at low speed, the grease discharge time can be shortened.)


<br>


Abnormal sound usually occur in the following cases.
1.	During operation after replacement of grease/reducer
2.	During operation after a long-term non-operation
3.	During operation at low speed
4.	During operation at low temperature
5.	When using unspecified grease
6.	Mixing of grease of different specifications

# 6.3.1. Reducers

If the reducer is damaged, phenomena such as vibration and abnormal sound will appear. In this situation, abnormalities such as overload and deviation that will interfere with normal operation can be caused, and abnormal heating may occur. Also, there are cases where the robot does not move at all or a position deviation occurs.

When required to replace the reducer, you must fix the arm with a fall-prevention bolt or pin before the work so that the arm does not fall.

* Investigation method

    ① Investigate whether there is any vibration, abnormal sound, abnormal heating, an error because of motor overload, etc. during the operation.

    ② Investigate whether there is any abnormal sound, tool overload, delay in replacement of grease, etc.

    ③ Investigate whether the robot has come into contact with or collided with a peripheral system before the occurrence of the abnormality.
(there are some cases where the reducer is damaged because of a contact-induced impact.)

* Handling method

    ① When it is judged to be the abnormal grease sound,

    - operate the relevant axis at high speed until the grease sound disappears.

    - If the abnormal sound does not disappear even after operating the axis at high speed for a long time, you should discharge the existing grease as much as possible and then inject new grease.

    ② Take measures to prevent tool overload, interference or collision with surroundings.

    ③ It is necessary to replace the reducer in the case of use in an overloaded state, collision, presence of foreign substances inside the reducer, or when grease has not been replaced for a long time. If you have any difficulty in replacing the reducer, please contact our service department.



# 6.3.2. Brake

When there is an abnormality in the brake, each axis may fall when the Operation Ready function in the [OFF] state. Or, on the contrary, the brake may operate even when the Operation Ready function in the [ON] state. Those situations will cause overload or noise.

![](../../_assets/작은주의표시.png) When required to move the manipulator without turning the motor [ON], you should turn the brake release switch [ON] and then move the manipulator. At this time, because the robot arm will fall because of gravity, you should first take measures to prevent the arm from falling, and then turn the brake release switch [ON.]

-	Investigation method

    While the Operation Ready function is in the [OFF] state, you should check if the operation sound comes from the brake by turning [ON] and [OFF] the brake release switch. If the operation sound of the brake is not heard, the switch is considered to be disconnected (When turning [ON] and [OFF] the brake release switch, you should pay special attention to the falling of the arm. The brake release switch is located on the board on the door side that can be seen when you open the controller door.)

-	Handling method

    Check the wiring, and if it is not disconnected, replace the motor.





# 6.3.3. Motor

If there is an abnormality in the motor, abnormal motions such as shaking when stopped, irregular cycle (pulsation), and vibration during operation may occur. In addition, abnormal heating and abnormal sound may occur.

Considering that a similar phenomenon occurs even when the reducer is damaged, you should investigate the reducer and bearing at the same time to determine where the cause is.

![](../../_assets/작은주의표시.png) You must fix the arm with a fall-prevention bolt or pin before the work so that the arm does not fall when you replace the motor.

*	Investigation method

    Investigate whether there is any abnormal sound or abnormal heating.

*	Handling method

    Replace the motor.


# 6.3.4. Encoder

If an encoder has an abnormality, it may cause position deviation, false operation, runaway, etc., which may lead to shaking when stopping or irregular pulsation. In addition, these troubles have nothing to do with the occurrence of mechanical abnormal sound, heating and vibration.

*	Investigation method

    ①	Investigate whether there is any abnormality in the encoder data.

    ②	Set to the reference position of the adjustment scale and check whether there is any error in the position data.

    ③	While moving each axis of the robot, investigate whether there is an axis showing an irregularity in the data.

    ④	Investigate whether an error does not occur when the servo amplifier board, BD542 is replaced. 
 
*	Handling method

    ①	Check the wiring, and if it is not disconnected, replace the encoder.

    ②	If no error occurs when the servo amplifier board BD542 is replaced, it is required to replace the servo amplifier board.
# 6.3.5. Gas springs

If the pressure of the gas spring drops excessively, it may cause abnormal heating and overloading in the motor or cause the arm to fall. 
Fill nitrogen gas so that the pressure does not drop more than 5 bar below the reference pressure.

Periodically inject grease into the upper and lower bearings of the gas spring to prevent the bearings from being damaged.

![](../../_assets/작은주의표시.png) Before checking the gas spring, you must ensure that the controller and external power are in the 『OFF』 state. Also, take measures to prevent the controller and external power from being accidently turned 『ON』 by someone else.
You must wear protective glasses when checking the gas pressure.

*	Investigation method

    ①	Check whether the pressure of the gas spring is appropriate.

    ②	Check if powder is generated because of grinding in the bearing part of the gas spring.

    ③	If grease has not been injected into the bearing for a long time, you should operate the robot to check if there is any abnormal vibration.


*	Handling method

    ①	Fill nitrogen gas so that the pressure of the gas spring reaches 140 bar.

    ②	Replace the gas spring with new one when its pressure drops within a short period of time after the filling of nitrogen gas, or when the gas spring has been in operation for a long time at low pressure.

    ③	Fill the grease in the bearing part.

    ④	Replace the bearing if it is abnormal.

    ⑤	If you have any difficulties with the handling method, please contact our service department.

    ⑥	For replenishing the gas, refer to the “Replenishing the Gas in the Gas Spring” section.

    ⑦	For the pressure criteria and replacement, refer to the “Replacing the Gas Spring” section.

If the encoder data shows abnormal values because of some troubles or because of replacement of the motor, the origin of the robot should be set again.

The scale is used as a method for determining the posture and position of each axis of the robot. When the user has replaced the motor, the user should set the encoder by using the origin setting scale for each axis.

</table># 8.2. Disposing of the Gas Spring

As gas springs are assembled with a high compression force, if the following procedures are not followed during the disposal stage, damage to life and property may occur. So you must observe the procedures for disposal.
# 8.2.1. Separating the Gas Spring

When separating the gas spring, you must keep the H axis in the posture shown in the figure below. In this posture, the compression force of the gas spring will be minimized so that it can be separated from the robot. Therefore, even if the gas spring is separated from the manipulator, the compression force by the spring will be in balanced state, so the risk factors in the separation process will be minimized.

However, when required to separate the gas spring for disposing of it or repairing its internal parts, you should first remove the gas completely in accordance with the procedure for discharging gas from the gas spring.

# 8.2.2. Disposing of the Gas Spring

Because the inside of the gas spring separated from the manipulator is still assembled with a high compression force, you should completely remove the gas according to the procedures of 9.3 Releasing the Gas of the Gas Spring,  and then confirm that the gas is completely removed and then dispose of the gas spring. Also, because a small amount of grease will still remain inside, you should handle it in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations in an environment sensitive to contamination. 
# 9. Maintaining the Gas Spring

Manage the gas spring so that it has an appropriate pressure through periodic maintenance. Replace the gas spring every 20,000 hours or when the proper working pressure (125 bar–140 bar) cannot be maintained even after gas is injected.

-	Nitrogen gas is filled at high pressure, so the safety regulations of the concerned country should be observed.
-	To prevent the arm from falling, you should maintain the pressure of the gas spring at an appropriate working pressure.
When required to operate the H axis manually, you must first check that the pressure of the gas spring is at an appropriate working pressure.
Never go under in the direction of the arm falling
-	Fill only nitrogen gas.
(Never charge other types of gas but also liquid nitrogen.)
-	Must wear safety glasses when working. 
-	Fill nitrogen gas so that the pressure does not drop more than 5 bar below the reference pressure.
-	Never look directly into the gas inlet and pressure gauge.
-	When the internal parts of the gas spring are damaged, you should secure safety by not placing any part of your body or major equipment in the operation direction of the gas spring, and then completely remove the gas.
(When an internal part is damaged, the compression force causes it to be thrown out at high speed, resulting in a safety accident.)
-	When required to separate the gas spring assembly unit, you should separate it while keeping the H axis of the robot at an angle of 90 degrees (teaching pendant). In this posture, the compression force of the gas spring is minimized, making it possible to separate it (In other postures, the gas spring compression force is high, so the bolts will be thrown out at high speed during the separation work, resulting in a safety accident.)
-	To consider safety and maintain the performance of the product, the works of disassembling and assembling the internal parts of the gas spring can be performed using only designated standard work tools and equipment as well as with appropriate trainings and understanding of the product. Please contact us for any inquiries regarding this.
-	When measuring the gas pressure, you should observe the instruction in the “Checking the Pressure of the Gas Spring” section because incorrect operation of the measuring device or mistakes in operating it may result in a drop in the gas pressure.
-	Before checking the gas spring, you must ensure that the controller and external power are in the 『OFF』 state. Also, take measures to prevent the controller and external power from being accidently turned 『ON』 by someone else.
-	When required to replace the gas spring, you must remove the gas pressure first.
-	When replacing an old gas spring, replace the bearing as well.
-	Regularly inject grease into the bearing part of the gas spring. 
(every 6 months, every 3 months in severe conditions)
-	When purchasing gas injection parts, you should include the specification of the nitrogen gas bombe connection screws.

Figure 9.4 Releasing the Gas of the Gas Spring# 9.4. Replacing (Separating and Assembling) the Gas Spring

When replacing the gas spring, you should replace the bearing assembled to the BS joint as well.
# 9.4.1. Separating the Gas Spring


You must keep the H axis at the posture as shown in [Figure 9.5] while separating the gas spring.

In this posture, the compression force of the gas spring will be minimized so that it can be separated from the robot.

Therefore, even if the gas spring is separated from the manipulator, the compression force by the spring will be in balanced state, so the risk factors in the separation process will be minimized.

However, when required to separate the gas spring for disposing of it or repairing its internal parts, or when impossible to put the H axis at 90° because the H axis does operate, you should remove the gas completely in accordance with the procedures of “9.3 Releasing the Gas of the Gas Spring.”

In the posture of the H axis at angles other than 90˚, the compression force of the gas spring will be excessive, so when the bolt of the hinge is loosened, the screw thread will be damaged by the pressure of the gas spring and the bolt will be thrown out, causing accidents involving people and damage to the equipment.)

# 9.4.2. Assembling the Gas Spring

When required to assemble the gas spring, you must put the H axis in the posture shown in [Figure 9.6].

In this posture, the compression force of the gas spring will be minimized so that it can be assembled to the robot.

-	 When fastening or loosening the hinge bolts to separate or disassemble the gas spring, you need to rotate the upper and lower bolts alternately at less than 45 degrees as shown in Figure 9.7 to prevent the hinge from being excessively tilted.
-	Excessive tilting of the hinge will damage the bolt screw, and thus damaged bolt screw will damage even the tap of the lower frame, making it difficult to perform the disassembling and assembling works.
-	The shape of each part, such as the hinge, may change according to the design for mass production.
