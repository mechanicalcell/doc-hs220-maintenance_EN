-	 Nitrogen gas is filled at high pressure, so the safety regulations of the concerned country should be observed.
-	Fill only nitrogen gas.
(Never charge other types of gas but also liquid nitrogen.)
-	Must wear safety glasses when working. 
-	Never look directly into the gas inlet and pressure gauge.
-	Replenishment and charging of the gas must be carried out while the gas spring has been assembled on the robot.
-	After charging the gas, allow about 30 minutes for the gas temperature to return to room temperature before the use.
-	Before checking the gas spring, you must ensure that the controller and external power are in the 『OFF』 state. Also, take measures to prevent the controller and external power from being accidently turned 『ON』 by someone else.
