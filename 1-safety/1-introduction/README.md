# 1.1. Введение

The main purpose of this chapter is to describe the matters concerning the safety of the users of the industrial robot and the workers who maintain and operate it.

This manual complies with the safety regulations of UC Machinery Directive 98/37/EC (2006/42/EC) and USA OSHA and describes the matters concerning the safety of the manipulator and controller. The manipulator and controller are manufactured in compliance with the safety standards EN ISO 10218-1:2006 and ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999.

Every worker who installs, replaces, adjusts, operates, preserves, and maintains the robot system, must thoroughly read, and fully understand the operation and maintenance manuals. In particular, it is required to pay special attention to the&nbsp;  ![](../../_assets/작은주의표시.png) symbol, the most important warning mark related to safety.

Installation, replacement, adjustment, operation, preservation, and maintenance of the robot system should be performed by those who are trained for these purposes, following the instructed work procedures.

As our company plans and performs trainings on preservation, maintenance, and operation for those works, the robot users should ensure that those working on the robot receive the relevant trainings. In addition, it must be ensured that only the workers who have completed this training courses can handle the robot.

The users of our industrial robot are responsible not only for clearly understanding and complying with safety-related laws related to robots applied in their countries, but also for properly designing, installing, and operating safety systems to protect workers working in our robot systems.

In dangerous areas, where the robot, tools, and peripheral systems are operating, safety devices should be prepared in accordance with ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999 to prevent objects other than workers and workpieces from entering those dangerous areas of the robot system. The systems should be configured so that the robot system can be immediately stopped by an emergency stop system in case a worker or object should enter the dangerous areas despite danger. The workers are responsible for installing, checking, and operating those safety systems.
